Snoopy Game


> I have for a long time had the idea to make a "game framework" for making (similar) levels, and then let users implement their own levels.
>
> Something very simple - like the old commodore 64 game Snoopy.
> Levels were single screen. The objective was go get from the left side to the right side
avoiding a few obstacles.
